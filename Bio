Hi, Iâ€™m Ankaj ðŸ‘‹
I am a Python developer passionate about building scalable and user-friendly web applications using Django and Flask. My journey started with backend development, and over time Iâ€™ve developed strong skills in designing APIs, working with databases, and integrating third-party services.

Currently, I am exploring the exciting world of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence to bring intelligent features into web apps. I enjoy experimenting with models in scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch, and deploying them into real-world applications using Django/Flask backends.

I believe the future of web development lies in AI-powered solutions â€” from chatbots and recommendation engines to data-driven dashboards â€” and my goal is to bridge the gap between traditional web apps and intelligent systems.

I also love collaborating on open-source projects, solving challenging problems on StackOverflow, and continuously learning to improve my craft.
